# Current status

The stronger-play and research extension is active. A new replicated match-win
improvement has not yet been established. Initial dealer selection and the
playable canonical model remain unchanged.

This file is a current snapshot. Detailed commands, failed approaches and work
accounting are in [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md). The complete preceding status
history is preserved at [commit80a1cf1](https://github.com/sheetau/koikoi/blob/80a1cf1/docs/STATUS.md).
Old process handles mentioned in that history are historical, not live jobs.

## Current experiment and next actions

**Multi-round public-memory study running:** producer46255 executes scripts.run_public_continuation_study via runs/launch_public_continuation_study.py;log runs/public_continuation_study.log. Protocol95ce0a01a76c790f5dbdeb0c78028199e61219053167fc7309543cfa4c4815a1 exactly matches preflight and all221 inputs verify. Parent1-public completed520 updates and passed an independently rerun endpoint check;parent1-masked is training. Both matched initial/warmup20 states agree exactly. Receipt runs/public_continuation_study/parent1_public_completion_verification.json SHA22ac11cb454d1a0074fcf267b24d69a4399cbb6f1bc3525fec2b883fd7b2a583 verifies231 inputs. Other arms and24,576 fresh93M strict matches follow the frozen schedule. Independent queue96354 waits for complete producer output,then runs scripts.audit_public_continuation_study;receipt runs/public_continuation_study_finish.json,8h observation deadline does not terminate the producer. Preserve both live processes and all bound scripts/tests/designs. Manuscript files are not bound and can be updated with completed prior results during training. No new strength outcome or promotion yet. Completion-only summarizer scripts/summarize_public_continuation_study.py is ready;the live incomplete study correctly refuses summary output. Run it once only after independent queue96354 succeeds.

The frozen [multi-round protocol](PUBLIC_CONTINUATION_STUDY.rst) uses both
original parents, public/masked memory, all855/876 natural public stopping roots,
520 updates per arm, and24,576 strict full matches on2,048 shared fresh93M deals.
The primary criterion requires public-minus-masked and public-minus-original
balanced-mixture win lower95% bounds to be positive for both parents. Report all
opponent-specific and point outcomes as well. Reserved101M deals remain unused.

Next: preserve producer46255 and independent queue96354;verify remaining completed
endpoints and matched initial/warmup states. After allfour arms finish,record
training completion and allow the existing strict evaluator to finish. After
the independent audit passes,run the prepared summarizer once. Do not inspect
partial win contrasts,select checkpoints,extend the fixed budget,or launch
duplicate trainers/evaluators. Do not edit any of the221 protocol-bound inputs.
Training and conditional completions are not strength evidence.

**Training diversity diagnostic:** the855/876 root banks contain717/756
distinct initial deal permutations. Completed parent1-public samples all855
roots47--111 times(mean77.85) over66,560 continuations;replayed root-index RNG
equals the final checkpoint exactly. No simulation or evaluation was added.
[Counts and possible chance-renewal comparison](CONTINUATION_ROOT_DIVERSITY.rst).
This measures finite chance reuse,not overfitting or strength. Finish the current
comparison before changing its sampling procedure.

**Chance-renewal CPU capability:** an isolated public-context constructor
preserves points,dealer and round while drawing new legal cards/future chance.
Three CPU tests pass,0 skips;all1,731 real roots reconstruct exactly at their
original keys and support1,731 fresh legal conditional deals. Receipt

[Scope and pending integration](CONTINUATION_CHANCE.rst). No GPU test,new trainer,
strength trial or modification of the current study has occurred.

## Completed evidence informing this experiment

**Public-memory round8 comparison independently complete:** producer67506 and audit35738 exit0;all24,576 full matches replay and all18 win/point contrasts reproduce exactly. Primary balanced-mixture gain fails;every win and point interval includes zero. Audit a5a9f350f2388294cdd106758d60eb453a2f03a24ff41f192436a04d4925acd7 verifies300,092 upstream input/mask checks and all181 input hashes. Actual evaluation2,857,337 decisions/191,262 rounds/24,576 matches;355,486 public-model predictions. Summarizer ran once;summary ca6182fb9e687e4c0a23237e161a4bc27de518ffb40e12b32c9b650e583fc985. [All outcomes](PUBLIC_MEMORY_RESULTS.rst). No promotion/extra old budget/101M use. Do not restart67506/35738 or resummarize over existing files.

Public-only identification reconstructs historical inputs after the eighth
opponent hand discard. It identified1,746 of2,048 retained training prefixes,
with302 unresolved and no wrong/empty classifications;1,598/1,856 natural
final-round roots were identified(86.1%). The prefixes share512 deals.
[Identification results](REVEALED_OPPONENT_IDENTIFICATION_RESULTS.rst).
There are1,731 eligible later fresh-round roots,855/876 per parent;1,642 precede
round8. [Bank construction](PUBLIC_MEMORY_CONTINUATION_BANK.rst).

Complete-continuation CPU/CUDA/online/resume capability passed before the current
study. Production audit1ba645ade180878ebf5e8803211abe46e1b1cc8161c160100b733b5fb0647bee
verifies both three-update arms and exact restarted updates;all214 inputs pass.
It is capability evidence,not a strength estimate.
[Implementation and checks](PUBLIC_MEMORY_CONTINUATION.rst).

The preceding unconditioned final-round study completed16,384 strict matches:
one parent/Point cell improved,but the replicated primary criterion failed.
[All outcomes](FINAL_ROUND_TRAINING_RESULTS.rst). Opening,mid-round and final-round
search studies likewise established no replicated win improvement;see
[mid-round](FIXED_MIDROUND_TERMINAL_RESULTS.rst) and
[final-round](FINAL_ROUND_RESULTS.rst) results. CPU singleton and fixed64 GPU
inference remain distinct numerical policies;do not claim action equivalence.
[Numerical analysis](NUMERICAL_BATCH_PRIOR_ART.rst).

Earlier controller,supervised-selector,direct-response,learner-return,
fixed-observer and public-seat comparisons also failed their replicated primary
win-gain criteria. Secondary gains remain reported in the manuscript and
EXPERIMENTS. Static RL-Point koi continuation improved expected point margins
in the measured development comparison,but did not establish a win gain.
None of these studies promoted a new human-play model. Completed studies and
capabilities are terminal;do not restart their directories.

The exact shared-parameter counterexample demonstrates reversed expected
updates under opponent-observation bootstrapping,including a finite cutoff at
lambda1. Learner-decision returns correct the complete finite example.
Public-seat and within-round reconstruction audits identify measured information
loss and verify representations. These are theoretical/representation results;
their empirical fixes did not establish replicated Koi-Koi win improvement.

## Latest manuscript

**Latest verified manuscript:**28 pages,31 references,171-word Abstract and20 embedded fonts. Related Work now explicitly covers showdown/fold Bayesian likelihoods,partial-revelation multiplayer adaptation,and policy-based hidden-deal inference. It identifies the contribution as exact Koi-Koi historical-input reconstruction,measured identification coverage and controlled downstream comparisons;delayed revelation/default-policy adaptation are not claimed as new principles. [Primary-source analysis](PUBLIC_MEMORY_PRIOR_ART.rst). Completed round8 public-memory negative results remain unchanged. All756 evidence inputs and221 live-study bindings verify;all28 pages rendered/contact-reviewed,with pages3/15/28 inspected full size. No box,glyph,reference or page-bound defects.

Previous PDF retained as output/pdf/manuscript_public_memory_c909f25f.pdf. Multi-round study remains running;no new strength result or promotion.

## Local human-play delivery

Added `python -m koikoi.play` and the Windows double-click launcher `play.cmd`. The Tkinter desktop client defaults to the hash-checked canonical seed6710001_warm checkpoint with greedy CPU2 inference, public endgame assistance and no search. Original assisted RL-WP/RL-Point and greedy practice opponents are selectable. The UI provides clickable card images, capture choices, koi/stop, public scores/captures, Japanese help, round-result pauses and new matches. It hides opponent hand identities, writes no match records and does not train or alter models. Card images are read from the unchanged pinned upstream checkout; no PySimpleGUI dependency or network service was added.

Validation: `python -m pytest tests/test_play.py tests/test_engine.py tests/test_endgame.py tests/test_upstream.py tests/test_published_ppo.py -q` passed45 with no skips (17 expected upstream Transformer warnings). The8 new tests include20 full controller/reference matches, both capture phases and koi continuation, wrong-turn/illegal-action rejection, hidden-hand/stock view invariance, Tk stop/result/restart/callback cancellation, dense-field layout at1000x750, a full canonical-model match and both original opponents. After final UI adjustments the8 UI/controller/model tests were rerun successfully. Ruff and diff checks pass. Actual Windows launch and card-click/AI-response paths were inspected through Computer Use. These are playability checks, not new strength estimates. Frozen research artifacts and original engine/inference files remain unchanged. README contains Japanese launch/operation/restoration instructions.

## Completed final evaluation

- Original session17151 exited0; actual runner45028 and workers35564/64780/45896/45888 are gone. All4 jobs completed10000 duplicate pairs. Never restart these original directories.
- Directory `runs/final_published_test`; process status `complete_awaiting_audit` is retained by design. Full `independent_audit.json` passes; its SHA256 is `891c765dec23edec33538174433d5105dabc443ca2da1a4f91d4273c965eade8`.
- Summary SHA256 `49a2babbb4e84043ef7101eff683ec7071094261dc2914ee99cb1e51dd7c692f`. Audit independently recomputed raw pair statistics and checked frozen identities/accounting; it does not replay all trajectories/inferences.
- Both model seeds x assisted RL-WP/RL-Point, strict CPU2 threads each, paper8, greedy, endgame assistance, no search. Total80000 matches/9281432 decisions on10000 shared unique deal streams, NOT40000 independent deals.
- Final seeds100000000-100009999 are consumed. No outcome-based retraining, reranking, extension or early stopping occurred. Canonical model remains seed6710001_warm.

All rows share5000 development pairs7,200,000-7,204,999. Initial policy gives exactly0.5/zero points on every pair. Earlier warm1000-pair screen was inconclusive; earlier failed search/training experiments remain disclosed. Development selection is not untouched confirmation.

Fixed rule selected **warm**, canonical **seed6710001_warm** (never the better-scoring seed). Warm T0.05/actor LR3e-6; cold T0.01/LR6e-7, so no isolated temperature causal claim.

Portable bytes/member/source/model checks and independent final statistics pass: primaryWP=true, secondaryPoint=false. Receipt `runs/research_artifact_bundle.json` records the actual archive. Independent PowerShell SHA agrees; archived README contains current model instructions and archived PDF matches final QA. Later metadata-only commits do not change this snapshot. Prior ef554ba ZIP and failed path-order ZIP are retained under distinct names. The verifier uses original-platform pathlib ordering; Windows/POSIX regressions cover the discovered ordering bug. [Scope/instructions](ARTIFACTS.rst). Nothing uploaded externally.

The archive is the original release snapshot,not the current extended
manuscript or a bundle of the new studies. Its successful completion does not
complete the active stronger-play objective. No journal submission or external
artifact publication has been performed.

## Operating and verification reminders

Use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Python3.12/Torch2.12+cu130/NumPy2.5.4),not system
Python3.14. CPU Ryzen9900X,GPU RTX5070Ti16GB. Read PowerShell text explicitly as
UTF8;preserve existing endings,new files UTF8 without BOM/LF. No subagents.
Only producer46255 and audit queue96354 are live research jobs at this snapshot;
confirm their actual handles before treating them as live later.

Keep full matches,rounds,decisions,conditional continuations and verification
replay separate. Policies must not read hidden hands,stock order,RNG or future
events. Preserve original models,comparators and all bound evidence. Use
targeted checks for changes;do not repeatedly rerun broad suites without a new
failure or concern. Audit scope varies:read each receipt before asserting
trajectory or neural-inference replay. The original release suite passed460
tests with0 skips;that historical result does not replace checks of new work.
